## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS



### What I learned

I guess I learned how to make a side nav and a dropdown menu without using framework like bootstrap or tailwind css. A few Javascript. And some mew html tags. 




### Continued development

I notice that I'm getting used to designing simple webpages, but with bad code or codes that are not scalable. So I want to learn how to make good, efficient, and scalable codes in the future.
