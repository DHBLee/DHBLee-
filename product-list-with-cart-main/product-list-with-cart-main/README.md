### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Plain vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned a lot when it comes to styling the website. A few learnings from JavaScript as I am starting to fully learn CSS and HTML, so I'm trying to focus on HTML and CSS than JavaScript. 




### Continued development

I'm planning ot learn JS after I mastered HTML CSS becasue so far, I really cannot understand Javascript so thats that. And hopefully learning the frameworks as well such as tailwind and React.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://chatgpt.com/) - Of course, ChatGPT. chatgpt helped me understand the codes, as well as giving solution to a certain problem. And it's really helpful when there are certain errors caused by  a spacing, a semi colon, a missed letter because chatgpt can easily detect that.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.reddit.com) - But of course, there's nothing better than asking people who have experienced wokring with these languages in reddit. Perspective of programmer is still better and has more insights to a problem than chatGPT.
