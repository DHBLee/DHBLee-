## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use grid-templates-areas to make it look like it's unevenly shaped. I was able to go from even grid containers to some having longer height or width, but still make an overall even shape.



### Continued development

I should learn how to do this type of design more efficient and oragnized. So far, I'm doing the brute force kind of styling where I just add things until all works. But I should plan how to to do it neatly and efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.chatgpt.com) - This helped in making the grid templates unevenly organized
