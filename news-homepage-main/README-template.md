## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JavaScript


### What I learned

This one is quite easy compared to the ones I've done. Maybe I learned how to use styles or tags more efficiently now. And organizing it more properly.



### Continued development

In the future, I want to continue designing much more complicated things, and hopefully master javascript along the way.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.chatgpt.com) - yeah, it's useful.
